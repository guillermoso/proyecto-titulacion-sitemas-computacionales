ABSTRACT = {Food security has become an increasingly important challenge for all countries globally, particularly as the world population continues to grow and arable lands are diminishing due to urbanization. Water scarcity and lack of labor add extra negative influence on traditional agriculture and food production. The problem is getting worse in countries with arid lands and harsh climate, which exacerbates the food gap in these countries. Therefore, smart and practical solutions to promote cultivation and combat food production challenges are highly needed. As a controllable environment, greenhouses are the perfect environment to improve crops&rsquo; production and quality in harsh climate regions. Monitoring and controlling greenhouse microclimate is a real problem where growers have to deal with various parameters to ensure the optimal growth of crops. This paper shows our research in which we established a multi-tier cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform to enhance the greenhouse microclimate. As a case study, we applied the IoT platform on cucumber cultivation in a soilless medium inside a commercial-sized greenhouse. The established platform connected all sensors, controllers, and actuators placed in the greenhouse to provide long-distance communication to monitor, control, and manage the greenhouse. The implemented platform increased the cucumber yield and enhanced its quality. Moreover, the platform improved water use efficiency and decreased consumption of electrical energy. Based on the positive impact on water use efficiency and enhancement on cucumber fruit yield and quality, the established platform seems quite suitable for the soilless greenhouse cultivation in arid regions.},

abstract = {In order to provide the best growing conditions for roses in a greenhouse, a Wireless Sensor Network has been designed and implemented that allows for agricultural environment data collection such as temperature, humidity and light. Each sensor node can transmit monitoring data to the cloud. Data mining techniques were used with the purpose of identifying behavioral patterns given the environment conditions captured by the sensor network. The operationalization of this research was taken as a case study within the rose greenhouses available to Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas – ESPE, Ecuador.}
